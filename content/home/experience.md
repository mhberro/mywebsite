  A healthcare services company that identifies and recoups overpayments to providers
  Achievements:
  
  * Programmed a healthcare graphical model using Azure Databricks, Spark, and Scala that performs a random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm on the graph to find patients with the most similarities to a target patient
  * Built a document store that used Azure Data Factory to ingest 50 million unstructured clinical notes weekly from multiple data sources into an Azure Data Lake Store
  * Streamlined and automated an ETL process, using SSIS and performance centric SQL programming paradigms, that onboards data from HMS clients into HMS servers, reducing previous load times by 75%
  * Self-Initiated, designed, created, tested, and deployed company-wide a WPF application, using C# and SQL, that grants vetted users the ability to update healthcare claim data without writing SQL queries, reducing each programmer’s hours by 65%
  * Provided subject matter expertise on six separate MSSQL subsystems responsible for onboarding client data to different
HMS data warehouses that, combined, account for approximately 40% of HMS’s total revenue stream
  * Provided multiple database performance tuning and optimization lectures to developers in a classroom setting, providing an in-depth view of clustered and nonclustered indexes from a data structure perspective along with other SQL Server insights
  * Led an initiative with multiple departments to architect a claim tracking system that provides account managers with a MicroStrategy dashboard detailing the movement of claim data throughout HMS servers, providing business with a layer of transparency that drastically reduced client abrasion
  * Built, using Python and sklearn, a network-based model that uses the Louvain algorithm and Markov chain to create communities of super
nodes consisting of high-risk claims, ranking the network of claims according to a measure each claim’s steady-state
probability
  * Wrangled data using Pandas to build a Gradient Boosting algorithm containing 60 Decision Tree models using scikit-learn, classifying claims with 88% accuracy
  * Architected and deployed data processing solutions that redefine HMS data onboarding principles to target and filter specific claims whose net savings is significantly higher than its peers, increasing net profitability by 20% over traditional processes
