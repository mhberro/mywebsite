  A healthcare services company that identifies and recoups overpayments to providers
  Achievements:
  
  * Led a team of 4 in building the infrastructure to automate the ingestion and transformation of data from an Azure
Data Lake Store into HMS servers using the Azure-SSIS integration runtime in Azure Data Factory
  * Provided subject matter expertise on six separate subsystems responsible for onboarding client data to different
HMS data warehouses that, combined, account for approximately 40% of HMS’s total revenue stream
  * Led an initiative with multiple departments to architect a claim tracking system that provides account managers
with a dashboard detailing the movement of claim data throughout HMS servers, providing business with a layer of
transparency that drastically reduced client abrasion
  * Streamlined and automated an ETL process for the onboarding of data from clients into HMS servers by reworking
load stored procedures to incorporate performance centric SQL programming paradigms, reducing previous load
times by 75%
  * Provided multiple database performance tuning and optimization lectures to developers in a classroom setting,
providing an in-depth view of clustered and nonclustered indexes from a data structure perspective along with other
SQL Server insights
  * Built a network-based model that uses the Louvain algorithm and Markov chain to create communities of super
nodes consisting of high-risk claims, ranking the network of claims according to a measure each claim’s steady-state
probability
  * Initiated, designed, created, tested, and deployed company-wide a WPF software application that’s written in C#
and uses an MVVM design pattern that links to SQL Server databases using Entity Framework and displays data via
XAML, reducing each employee’s man hours by 50 hours/week
  * Wrangled data using Pandas to build a Gradient Boosting algorithm containing 60 Decision Tree models using scikit-learn, classifying claims with 88% accuracy
  * Architected and deployed data processing solutions that redefine HMS data onboarding principles to target and filter specific claims whose net savings is significantly higher than its peers, increasing net profitability by 20% over traditional processes

  Achievements:
  * Designed and developed as chief engineer for a high-profile project a dual simplex algorithm that reduced the processing time of a fighter jet’s onboard systems by 20% and improved asset recognition by 25%, reducing maintenance costs by 15%
  * Interviewed high ranking military officers and led a team of five programmers to design and develop new functionality for a $500K software, leading to challenge coin award from a commander for recognition in enhancing user productivity by 400%
  * Designed and documented software architecture for three different software improvements and conducted peer reviews with team to identify potential design flaws within two months
  * Negotiated a $60K contract extension for software enhancements by forging relationships with division heads and collaborating cross functionally with lead engineers, resulting in performance improvements of 15% and operability on four defense platforms
  * Oversaw integration of a $250K instrument to automate outdoor test ranges and provided Congressional Demonstrations to gain project recognition, resulting in a 30% increase in test accuracy, 25% decrease in test time, and 15% decrease in test costs
  * Managed a team of four Electrical Engineers to effectively analyze the effects of electromagnetic interference on cell phone jammers using a state-of-the-art $2M instrument, composing over 10 in-depth reports for fleet lieutenants, becoming a subject matter expert on the effects of radio frequency signals in an electromagnetic environment
